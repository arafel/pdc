PDC - the programmers desktop calculator
========================================

PDC is a desktop calculator similar to bc but with features designed 
for use by programmers. In particular PDC supports most ANSI C 
operators including bitwise operators and shifts. PDC also makes 
dealing with mixed bases very easy since it supports contant pefixes 
(eg 0xff, 0755).

PDC is licenced under the GNU General Public Licence. The latest 
version of PDC can be downloaded from http://www.redfelineninja.org.uk.
Jason Hood has ported PDC to DOS/Win32 (in five different ways). These
ports can be found at http://pdc.adoxa.cjb.net.


Features
--------

 * mathematic operators +, -, *, /, %
 * logic operators &&, ||, !
 * bitwise operators &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
 * uses ANSI C operator precedence
 * prefix numbers with 0b, 0, 0d and 0x to support binary, octal,
   decimal and hex regardless of input base
 * output numbers in any number base of 16 or less
 * functions to assist with 'bit bashing'
 * command line expression evaluation


Building PDC
------------

PDC is supplied with a simple makefile. It should build with no
modifications on most Unix-like operating systems. However, you may need
to change the compilation flags (for example, to remove -Wall) if
you are not using gcc.

By default PDC is built against the GNU readline library. If your system
does not have the library installed, set WITHOUT_READLINE on the make
command line (make WITHOUT_READLINE=1). You'll know if you don't have the
library due to all the errors. :-)  DJGPP users who have CmdEdit installed
can use that instead by setting HAVE_CMDEDIT.

PDC is tested most often on Solaris and GNU/Linux. It's written in YACC and C.
