PDC - the programmers desktop calculator
========================================

PDC is a desktop calculator similar to bc but with features designed 
for use by programmers. In particular PDC supports most ANSI C 
operators including bitwise operators and shifts. PDC also makes 
dealing with mixed bases very easy since it supports contant pefixes 
(eg 0xff, 0755).

PDC is licenced under the GNU General Public Licence. The latest 
version of PDC can be downloaded from http://www.redfelineninja.org.uk.
